/*
about this script:

this joystick can bet set to drag along with the finger on the screen or stay in a fixed position 
limits drag to the right-side half of the screen
sets the maximum distance the joystick handle can be relative to the center of this joystick (default is 4)
calculates and ouputs a normalized direction vector for another script to use in order to control movement of a game object (example, a player character or any desired game object)

    see the demo scene DualJoystickDemo or RightJoystickDemo to see how the game objects for this joystick are setup:
    this script must be placed on a game object within a UI Canvas
    this script requires a UI image component to be on the game object (this is the background image of this joystick)
    this script requires a child game object that has a UI Image component on it for the handle of this joystick (this is the handle image of this joystick
    the required child handle image must be positioned and anchored to the center to the background image

                the inputVector (that will be output as the direction vector to control movement of a game object such as character or any desired game object) is created from these values
                the inputVector however is still unormalized, this means that if you drag outside of the boundaries of the image the values
                will continue to increase, also, dragging outside of the circular part of the image onto its transparent area will still register,
                so that dragging to a corner of the image (for example the bottom left corner) will give a value of x,y (-1,-1) which is not correct because the 
                the circular part of the image does not actually reach that far

                the solution to this (further down this script) will be to normalize the vector (remove it's magnitude) so that its value of x or y never increases past 1
